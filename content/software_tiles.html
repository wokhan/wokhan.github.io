<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
Depending on the feature the user would like to use, the Smart Tiles application can access the following personal data:
<ul>
    <li>Windows Calendar entries (including events details)
    <br />Data from the calendar is required when using the various events-based Smart Tiles options (after all, the app main goal is actually to display such information!)</li>
    <li>Windows Contacts (solely their names and birthdays)
    <br />Data from contacts is only used when birthday detection or listing is enabled.</li>
    <li>Local files (when the user picks a custom background picture)
    <br />For a bit of real customization, the user might choose to pick a custom picture ; of course it wouldn't work without actually accessing the selected files (and only those ones!)</li>
</ul>
Wokhan Solutions does not collect nor uses this information outside the application in any way.
