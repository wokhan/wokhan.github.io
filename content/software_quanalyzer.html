    <h2>QuAnalyzer</h2>
    <h3>Free / Open-source</h3>
</div>

QuAnalyzer is a data-oriented tool I started working on around 2012. It has evolved a lot since, but has never been publicly released.

<h2 class="getit">How to get it</h2>
While it has been open-sourced, no binaries have been released yet, as QuAnalyzer has been recently rewritten with WinUI3 and Uno Platform.
