 Why this website?</h2>
        <blockquote>If a solution does not exist yet, it does not mean there will never be any, but that it still has to be invented.</blockquote>
        This website presents some applications I created during many years as a hobby and wanted to share with the community. 
        Those applications have been created when no convincing alternatives exist (or I wasn't able to find them...), and were not only created for others but also because of actual personal needs.
