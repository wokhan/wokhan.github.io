 Why this website?</h2>
        This website presents some applications I created on my free time during the last 20 years as a hobby and wanted to share with the community. 
        <br />
        Those applications have been created when no convincing alternatives exist (or I wasn't able to find them...), and were not only created for others but also because of actual personal needs.
        <br />
        You will find some details about the following apps:
        <ul>
            <li>QuAnalyzer: a data analysis/browsing/comparison tool, supporting virtually any source through data providers.</li>
            <li>WFN: a well known Windows firewall extender.</li>
            <li>SmartTiles: a now deprecated app for Windows 10 / Windows 10 Mobile to create customized live tiles (firstly for Outlook, then for any datasource).</li>
            <li>Wokhan.Core: a library for .NET Standard / .NET Core/5+</li>
            <li>Wokhan.UI: a library for WPF or UWP UI frameworks.</li>
            <li>Wokhan.DataProviders: a library used by QuAnalyzer and other apps to generically access to various datasources.</li>
            <li>And some others you'll find through this site menu.</li>
        </ul>
